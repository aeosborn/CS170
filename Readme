# Ethereum Data Pipeline

This repository contains a Python-based pipeline for scraping and processing Ethereum blockchain data. The project is divided into two main pipelines:

1. **Feature Pipeline**: Extracts Ethereum blockchain features, including whale transactions and price data.
2. **Scraping Pipeline**: Scrapes sentiment analysis data related to Ethereum from various online sources.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive dataset for analyzing Ethereum blockchain activity and sentiment. The feature pipeline focuses on on-chain data, while the scraping pipeline gathers off-chain sentiment data to provide a holistic view of Ethereum's ecosystem.

## Feature Pipeline: Extracting Blockchain Data

### Description
The feature pipeline processes Ethereum blockchain data to extract key features such as:
- Whale transactions (large transfers of Ethereum).
- Historical price data.

### Running Feature Pipeline

## Locally [Conda Recommended]
1. Install Python 3.12+
2. Install requirements

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Update .env
4. Execute

    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

## Docker
1. Update .env
2. Build & Run Dockerfile

    ```bash
    docker build -t Dockerfile "eth_pipeline" && docker run -detach "eth_pipeline"
    ```

## Scraping Pipeline: Sentiment Analysis Data

### Description
The scraping pipeline collects sentiment data from online sources such as social media, news articles, and forums. This data is used to analyze the public perception of Ethereum.

### Execution
[ 4/4 ] 
1. Pray



## TODO

1. Add scaling for eth limits based on wanting to collect a proportion of transactions - HARD
2. Add K8s Execution - Medium
   1. Add Kubernettes Runtime - Need Sarvesh/Compute Layer
3. Look at alternate Provider URLs
